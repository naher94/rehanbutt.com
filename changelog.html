      <p>My release schedule is not what you typically see. Rather than waiting and bundling a bunch of cool stuff for a major version. I release them as they are ready and the branding and celebration comes towards the end of the year, ready to explore new adventure in the year to come.</p>
      <p>Explore the release celebration as part of my year in review each year!</p>
      <p class="build">This site is designed in a sketchbook, Sketch & Figma, built using Jekyll, Foundation CSS and Github Pages for hosting. Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Photo were fired up for images and photography and later optimzied in ImageOptim.</p>
