Shine Registry is a platform that gives founders a platform to ask for support as they are starting their businesses. One of the goals of this redesign was to __________________...

goal to sort out a more robust infomation architecture and implement the rebrand across the site. Check out the <a href="{% link _projects/shineregistrybrand.markdown %}">rebrand</a> that we also did for Shine Registry.

Extend the rebrand to the entire site

 help formalize a growing start-upâ€™s visual identity with its existing community while also introducing a more scalable and cohesive brand system as it continues to expands.

If a lot of content search and discovery becomes and issue and that was something that we focused on. Esspially with the 'Tag Callout' pages as we like to call them. Giving a community or group the opportunity to bubble up a little about themselves and all the folks that are a part of it if on the platform.

Which also leads to a natural progression of helping bring new folks to the table through partnerships.

The biggest architecural change we made was seperating the idea of a registry or bussiness and the owner of that registry, previously they were one in the same, so if you supported someone else on the platform it was as your bussiness. You also noticed that overtime it became conceptually merky based on some of the content that better represented individuals and not their businesses.

Giving folks to seperate themselves from their businesses and allow for a business to have more collbrators on the platform as they grow.
