Interchange, a career event, was created as a way to help the graduate students of Carnegie Mellonâ€™s School of Architecture to help them connect with the creative industry. As part of this new initiative I branded and developed a website for students to showcase their work ahead of the event. It will provide organizations an opportunity to learn about student's work within different degree programs; from architectural building performance to computational design.

As this site will be used by many students, I templated and created a style guide throughout the site for a uniform look and feel. Keeping in mind the need for a variety of content types and optional information fields such as personal websites and resumes on the profile pages. I built the site using Jekyll to template each page and to automate the connection of pages such as people and their projects and tagging people with their degree program. <a href="https://interchange.soa.cmu.edu">Check out the site.</a>
