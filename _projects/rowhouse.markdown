As part of this project we were asked to create a hexagon tile and incorporate it into the house design.  I used it as a starting place, creating a grid based on it. Giving me the opportunity to create 4 basic shapes.

I wanted to incorporate a time-based aspect into the house, so I decided to use the tile in order to create a waterfall wall. The tiles are made out of copper allowing them to rust, changing color and texture, giving a new aspect to your house over the years.
