Shine Registry is a platform that gives founders a platform to ask for support as they are starting their businesses. One of the goals of this rebrand was to help formalize a growing start-up’s visual identity with its existing community while also introducing a more scalable and cohesive brand system as it continues to expands.

Explored the existing world of Shine Registry to get a sense for the brand and its visual identity.

Audited the existing color and shape languages. Starting with the colors, I wanted to expand the palette for a greater diversity of use cases both on and off the web and wanted to ground the primary color a bit allowing each business to out shine the platform’s brand. Resulting in a wider range of colors and a more earthen palette.

Similarly with the shape language, it was important to give greater contrasts between different elements on the platform. It was also important to add a more natural feel to the site, better reflecting the entrepreneurs and their businesses that are on Shine Registry.
