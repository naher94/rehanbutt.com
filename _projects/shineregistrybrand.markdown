Shine Registry a platform that _________________ as part of the branding we wanted to explore the idea of light and see if there was a way the users could be the light of the brand in the same way to they do on the platform.

A start-up.. helping to formailze its design language.. for ease of the users.....

Explored the existing world of Shine Registry to get a sense for the brand and its visual identity.

Audited the existing color and shape languages. Starting with the colors I wanted to expand the palette for a greater diversity of use cases both on and off the web and wanted to ground the primary color a bit allowing each business to out shine the platformâ€™s brand. Resulting in a wider range of colors and a more earthen palette.

Similarly with the shape language, it was important to give greater contrasts between different elements on the platform. It was also important to add a more natural feel to the site, better reflecting the entrepreneurs and their business that are on Shine Registry.

Bringing together the color and shape languages to create this really sharp, natural and inviting tone. See how the new brand language was used across the platform as part of the <a href="{% link _projects/shineregistry.markdown %}">redesign</a>.
