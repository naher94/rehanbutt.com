in addition ot the logo another major part of consumer reports branding is their iconic rating system. a motified verions of Harvey balls. the red circle indicated the highest rating, the half red and white circle was the second highest rating, the white circle was neutral, the half black circle was the second-lowest rating, and the entirely black circle was the lowest rating possible.

furthur exploration beyond my time at Consumer Reports was needed to look into a rating system. should it remain a 5point system or does it change to a percentage or another scale. these questions led to a need to discuss the ganularity of the data that could and should be exposed from the tests run interally to the users. Check out 1 of these explorations on the data viz work I did with Consumer Reports.
