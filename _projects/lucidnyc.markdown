LucidNYC is an inspirational, informative, and popular salon series which introduces attendees to cutting edge projects by leading innovators across all fields. Lucid was developed to gain early insight into new trends and to track the pulse of cultural and technological change among early adopters and influencers.

Throughout this project the goal for the team was to bring to light the interesting stories shared by the future viewing speakers, under a new brand and web language.
