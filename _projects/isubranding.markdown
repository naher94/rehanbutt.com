## Process

When starting this project I looked at what words described the International Student Union and what we do as an organization. I came up with the following: diverse, connected, global, community, social and fun.

<div class="image-container">
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUinspiration.png" alt="Inspiration / Research" />
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUiteration1.png" alt="Iteration 1" />
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUiteration2.png" alt="Iteration 2" />
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUiteration3.png" alt="Iteration 3" />
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUiteration4.png" alt="Iteration 4" />
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUiteration5.png" alt="Iteration 5" />
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUiteration5.png" alt="Iteration 6" /></div>

These are the iterations I created for the brand image. Using different shapes and segments using five components as a symbol for the five inhabited continents. Looking at flag patterns and golden rectangles as one structure generating the logo.

<div class="image-container"><img src="../img/ISU/ISUcolorText1.png" alt="Text Iteration" />
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUcolorText2.png" alt="Color Iteration" /></div>

This was the first high fidelity logo I came up with. Looking at text positioning relative to the logo and color as the next step in the process.


<div class="image-container"><img src="../img/ISU/ISUlogoV1.png" alt="Logo V1" class="image-center" style="width:60%" /></div>

After this logo I realized that the color worked as it was bright and as orange is a secondary color it incorporated several components, while the logo itself had no relation to any of the terms I had compiled, diverse, connected, global, community, social and fun.

<div class="image-container">
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUiteration7.png" alt="Iteration 7" />
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUiteration8.png" alt="Iteration 8" /></div>

I used the idea of interlocked circles similar to that of the olympic rings as a new direction or pattern for a more conceptually centered logo.

<div class="image-container">
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUweaveColor.png" alt="Color Iteration" />
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUweavePattern.png" alt="Overlay Iteration" /></div>

This led me to the final logo. Where I then looked into a color palette for each of the four segments. After I decided on the colors I looked into how the segments would tie in to one another. At the end I went with this color pattern and the half overlapped segments.

<div class="image-container">
<img src="../img/ISU/ISUposter.png" alt="Poster Design" class="image-center" style="width:40%" /></div>

Using this new brand image I created a poster for one of our events.
