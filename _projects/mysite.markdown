The goal with this new site was to make sure it was fully responsive and make sure it was clean in both design and development, as my site has grown quite a bit since it was first launched. There were many technical improvements as well that were made and of course it continues to evolve, check out the transformation over on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/naher94/rehanbutt.com" rel="noreferrer">github</a>. With the refresh I also wanted to streamline <a href="/mybrand">my brand</a> explore that project after this one to see the full picture.

  <div class="cell">
      <img src="../img/mySite/newThumbnails.png" alt="Development Screenshot" />
  </div>

During the development process I needed to recreate many of the assets including the thumbnails to match the new specifications and to match the column width on all screen sizes.
