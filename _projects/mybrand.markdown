With the refresh of my site I also wanted to refresh my visual brand identity, specifically reduce the complexity of the graphic while keeping the reference to my name. One of the first elements I looked into was reducing the number or horizontal lines in the logo, then crisping up the corners by removing the chamfers.

  </div>
</div>

## Process

  </div>
  <div class="cell">
    <img src="../img/mybrand/logohorizontal.svg" alt="High Fidelity Logo Iteration Exploring horizontal alignment" />
  </div>
</div>
In order to reduce the number of horizontal lines I had to either slide the middle segment of the “E” down or move the “R” horizontal up. I decided to slide the “E” segment down so that I did not mess with the curvature of the “R”.
