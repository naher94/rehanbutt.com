Joining the game from your seat in stadium or at home

<!-- <div class="image-container"><img src="../img/cavs-ar/deepinTheQHero.png" alt="Hero Image"/></div> -->

As part of my time at YinzCam, I worked with the Cleveland Cavaliers to design an augmented reality (AR) experience for use by their fans in and out of the stadium. Deep in The Q is a virtual hoops game allowing fans to join the game from their couch at home or from their stadium seat. The experience is triggered by several targets placed in stadium and at select watch parties as well as numerous Bud Light products. Many Cav-centric achievements were added in-game for die-hard fans to unlock. Before select games fans in attendance could compete against each other from anywhere in the arena to win some awesome prizes.

Some of the In-stadium zones that were set up for game day. Want to play along at home? Download the app: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deep-in-the-q/id1225687551?mt=8">iOS</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yinzcam.deepintheq&hl=en">Android</a> Once you have downloaded the app, point the camera view at this target and shoot some baskets! Sound effects are included by the way, so turn that volume up!

A couple of the many interactions and animations that were designed. Point increase counter, target recognition interface, fire ball for long streaks and an achievement animation.
