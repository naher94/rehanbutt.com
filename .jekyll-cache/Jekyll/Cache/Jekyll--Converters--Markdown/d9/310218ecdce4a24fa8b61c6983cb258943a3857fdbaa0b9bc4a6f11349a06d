I"<p>As an Adobe creative suites, AutoDesk and Rhinoceros 3D user, I realized there are a couple very intuitive feature missing in the creative suite. One of the best and simplest features in AutoCAD and Rhino is the universal search or command bar. It helps pull up the tool you need without having to remember the short cut or the icon associated with it. The command bar also exists in these more technical applications because there are many tools that one could use. If short cuts were implemented for all of these tools, they would require several keys each and would create a tool bar that was the entire interface. Another thing I noticed was for the Windows user there was no built-in way to search for an action in the drop down menus as you can on a Mac within the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù menu.</p>
