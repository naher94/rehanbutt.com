# Hello & Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

You have found the `readme` for the [rehanbutt.com](https://rehanbutt.com) codebase. Feel free to explore the code and see how my site is built.

I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) as my static site templating engine and [Foundation for Site](https://get.foundation/sites.html) as my CSS and JS framework.

Curious how the site has evolved over time? Check out the [releases](https://github.com/naher94/rehanbutt.com/releases) over the years. Pretty fun to time travel! Like my own personal [waybackmachine](http://web.archive.org) ðŸ˜‰
