I created this project for a friend who loves puzzles. As such I wanted to create an original and unique image to be used on the puzzle. I went through several iterations of what I wanted the image to be. The one thing I knew from the very beginning of this project was that it had to have coffee and sushi on it. So how did I come up with this? Well recently I have come across many hero images on the web of desks and wanted to create a custom one with a flat UI feel.
