## Process

<div class="image-container" style="margin-top:100px; margin-bottom:100px"><img src="../img/appleNews/overTheYears.png" alt="Apple News Icon Over the Years"/></div>

I wanted to look back at where the current Apple News has been and what the design language of it has been over the years starting back when News was Newsstand.

<div class="image-container" style="margin-top:100px; margin-bottom:100px;"><img src="../img/appleNews/macAppIconGrid.png" alt="Mac App Icon Grid"/></div>

My first step in designing the icon for Apple News was looking at the 3 icon types and their grids that were introduced with Mac OS X Yosemite. I decided to use the rotated rectangle as it maps closest to a newspaper. The other reason I chose the rotated rectangle is because both the icons for Notes and Reminders also resemble that of a analog paper stack.

<div class="image-container" style="margin-top:50px; margin-bottom:100px"><img src="../img/appleNews/macApps2.png" alt="Mac Apps"/></div>

I took a look at several differant Apple applications. Looking at the differant navigation paradigms, styles, grids and scale of differant components.

Iterations of the small article type, with varying text and logo alignments and image placements with in a horizontal bounding area. I used the research and stylings of existing Apple apps and Apple News on iOS to create Apple News for MacOS, with the intention to bring a great news application to the entire Apple eco-system.
